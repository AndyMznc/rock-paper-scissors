Very early README, also, english is not my primary language.

## Start the project
- git clone this project
- pnpm install (install dependencies)
- pnpm run dev (start project)

## Identify the project
•	Each turn, each player selects one action among "Rock," "Paper," and "Scissors"
•	The hierarchy of actions is as follows: Rock < Paper < Scissors < Rock < Paper ...
•	If both players choose the same action, it results in a tie, and no one scores a point.
•	When starting a match, we count: "Rock, Paper, Scissors." At the end, we reveal our choices.
•	A game can be either Best of 3 (BO3), where the first player to win 2 games wins the match, or Best of 5 (BO5), where the first player to win 3 games wins the match. The choice is up to the players.
•	It is also possible to play this game with more than two players. In that case, the winner is the last one remaining.
